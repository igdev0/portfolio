          <p>
            My name is Ianos, and Iâ€™m from Cluj-Napoca, Romania. After graduating high school in 2014, I embarked on an
            exciting journey, moving to London in 2015. Driven by a passion for technology, I began teaching myself web
            programming in 2016 through platforms like Codecademy, Udemy, Pluralsight, FreeCodeCamp, and resources like
            the Mozilla Developer Network and W3Schools.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2018, I took a significant step in my career by working with my first freelance client. It was a
            rewarding experience where I not only started earning my first income in the field but also had the
            privilege of delivering value and happiness to my clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            By 2022, I achieved a major milestone by signing my first employment contract as a professional software
            developer. Over the next two years, I honed my skills, contributed to meaningful projects, and grew
            tremendously. Later, I transitioned into a B2B role with a large corporation, where I continued to thrive
            and make an impact.

            In early 2024, I made the deliberate decision to take a well-deserved break to recharge, reconnect with my
            social life, and embrace the moments that come with closing the chapter on my 20s. Itâ€™s been a fulfilling
            journey so far, and Iâ€™m excited about what the future holds as I continue to grow both personally and
            professionally.

            What is next...
          </h3>
          <p>
            As I step into the next phase of my journey, Iâ€™m eager to embrace new challenges and opportunities that push
            me to grow both personally and professionally. My focus is on deepening my expertise in software
            development, particularly in cutting-edge fields like blockchain technology, decentralized applications, and
            innovative web solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Iâ€™m also passionate about contributing to impactful projects that make a difference, whether itâ€™s through
            creating efficient, user-centric applications or collaborating on open-source initiatives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking ahead, I aim to combine my technical skills with my curiosity and creativity to build products that
            not only solve real-world problems but also inspire others. Whether itâ€™s joining a dynamic team, leading new
            projects, or continuing my journey of self-improvement, Iâ€™m excited about the possibilities on the horizon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Letâ€™s build something amazing together! ðŸš€
